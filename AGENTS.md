# AGENTS.md

## Project

Static SPA for https://admissionhub.pages.dev, deployed to Cloudflare Pages
(project `admissionhub`, production branch `main`). `index.html` and
`courses/*/index.html` are hash-routed entry pages; `_worker.js` is an
advanced-mode Pages worker that proxies `/api/*` and gates asset serving.

## Build and deploy

- `dist/` is **not** committed. CI (`.github/workflows/cf-pages.yml`) rebuilds it
  from the repo root with an `rsync` exclude list; root files are the source of
  truth, so never commit the `dist/` mirror.
- Deployment is a manual `workflow_dispatch`:
  `wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name admissionhub --branch main`.
  Requires `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- **Manual deploy workflow:** `.github/workflows/deploy-pages-worker.yml`
  (`confirmation: DEPLOY`) publishes both the Worker bundle and the Pages UI from
  `main` using repository secrets. It is deploy-only — no Firebase, mailbox or
  secret mutation. Merging to `main` does **not** deploy on its own; run this
  workflow (or dispatch it via the API) whenever `main` must reach production.
- Local deploy without `rsync` (not installed here): replicate the exclude list
  in Python, then run wrangler via `npx --yes wrangler@3 pages deploy dist ...`.

## SEO invariants (enforced by the CI bundle guard)

- Crawler files ship as real files, never the SPA shell: `robots.txt`,
  `sitemap.xml`, `favicon.ico`, `og-image.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`.
- Root page: unique `<title>`, canonical, OG/Twitter tags, JSON-LD `@graph`
  (`WebSite`, `Organization`, `WebApplication`).
- Each course landing page needs its own canonical, description, OG tags and a
  parseable JSON-LD `@graph` containing a `Course` node.
- `_worker.js` converts Pages' catch-all 200 HTML fallback into a real 404 for
  unknown paths and missing assets, while keeping `/`, `/courses/*`,
  `/AH-[A-Z2-9]{6}` and hash routes at 200.
- The root `<body>` is an app shell, so without JS it exposes only the loading
  splash (84 characters) while every course landing page is fully prerendered.
  A `<noscript>` block after `#modalRoot` carries the real pitch and links to
  the course pages; `intro.test.mjs` guards it. Keep that markup *inside*
  `<noscript>` — the splash, `body.app-booting` and `#app` are a tested boot
  contract (tests ১–১১), and the engine/`renderShell` replace `#app`'s innerHTML
  wholesale, so prerendered copy placed there would simply be thrown away.
  Its `<style id="ah-nojs-min">` sits in `<head>` next to `ah-boot-min` because
  `<style>` is only valid there; JS-on browsers ignore it as nothing then
  matches `.ah-nojs`.

## Testing

- `node --test seo-routing.test.mjs` ÔÇö routing/404 contract.
- Baseline failures unrelated to SEO: `account-retirement.test.mjs`,
  `p18-legacy-dashboard-kill.test.mjs`, `startup-ai-regression.test.mjs`.
  Compare against `git worktree add /tmp/base origin/main` before blaming a change.

## Conventions

- Public profile IDs match `^AH-[A-Z2-9]{6}$` (no `0`/`1`); `/AH-* / 200` in
  `_redirects` hands the path to the SPA.
- `rsync` and `file` are unavailable in this sandbox; use Python equivalents.
- Preference values have two sources of truth that must agree: the default and
  allow-list in `loadPrefs()` (`profile-ui.js`) and the modes accepted by the
  global `AhAppearance` engine (`index.html`). Adding a mode in only one place
  makes the saved value silently reset on reload while the engine keeps
  rendering it ÔÇö the v267 `green`/Premium Green bug.
- Any change to a versioned asset requires a coordinated bump: the `?v=` query
  in `index.html`, `BUILD_ID` + `expectedSwVersion` in `index.html`/`sw.js`, and
  the shell version asserted across many `*.test.mjs` files. Bump the `SW shell`
  and `profile-vNN` markers together, then run `node scripts/sw-manifest.mjs` to
  regenerate `ASSET_DIGESTS` in `sw.js`, or the SW precache rejects the shell.
  The `BUILD_ID` literal also lives in
  `.github/workflows/telegram-auth-canary-activate.yml`, which verifies the
  deployed shell; a partial bump fails `interactive-native-personal-v1.test.mjs`.
- User-facing copy is Bengali by default and English is applied at runtime by
  `language-engine.js`, not by per-module conditionals. Modules keep writing
  Bengali; the engine rewrites text nodes plus `placeholder`/`aria-label`/`title`
  on `ah:lang` and on DOM insertion. Add new copy to its `DICT`.
  - Bengali must be NFC-normalised before dictionary lookup: Óª»Óª╝ is either U+09DF
    or Óª» + Óª╝, and the two look identical. A naive comparison silently misses
    entries ÔÇö this cost 36 account strings when first written.
  - `language-engine.test.mjs` fails when the account or profile UI renders a
    Bengali string the table lacks, so the guard catches untranslated copy added
    later. The scan reads plain JS string literals too, not only markup: copy in
    a `row('­ƒîÉ', 'Language', ...)` call or a toast is never inside a tag, and
    scanning markup alone is what let ~230 strings ship untranslated.
  - `language-coverage-runtime.test.mjs` boots the real modules with the engine
    in English mode and fails on any Bengali text node or attribute still on
    screen. Keep both: the static scan catches a missing key, the runtime one
    catches a key that exists but never reaches the DOM.
  - Strings that embed a live number (resend timers, passkey totals, the
    multi-device logout notice) cannot have a fixed key, so `RULES` matches them
    by shape. `translateSegment` additionally translates one segment of a
    `┬À`-joined string, a Bengali date (`ÓººÓºº ÓªÅÓª¬ÓºìÓª░Óª┐Óª▓, Óº¿ÓºªÓºªÓº¡`) and digit-only runs.
    Bengali digits are U+09E6ÔÇôU+09EF and are outside `\d`, so a bare `\d` pattern
    silently fails on them.
  - The engine writes node values, so it must distinguish its own output from a
    module's later rewrite. `lastOut` holds what the engine wrote; when the node
    no longer matches it, that new value is the source to translate. Without
    this, a count-up animation is frozen at its first frame and keeps the
    Bengali digits it started with.
- The language and appearance engines each keep their own `localStorage` key
  (`ahLang`, `ah-appearance`) while `profile-ui.js` keeps the synced preference
  in `ah-profile-prefs-v1`. Only the profile picker writes both, so boot
  reconciles them (`reconcilePreferencesAtBoot`). Direction matters: with no
  preference saved the engine key is the real choice and seeds the preference,
  otherwise first run overwrites the user with defaults.
  - `AhI18n.set` now mirrors the choice into an existing `ah-profile-prefs-v1`
    record (it does not create one). Without this the welcome picker — the first
    language control a visitor meets — moved `ahLang` alone, and boot reconcile
    then read the stale saved preference and snapped the app back to Bengali.
  - Never persist the choice from `account-access.js`: `native-auth-protection`
    scans that file for the browser storage globals and fails the build if any
    appear, comments included. Persistence stays in the engines.
  - A runtime test that seeds English *before* boot cannot see a picker that
    fails to store the choice. `language-coverage-runtime.test.mjs` boots in
    Bengali and drives the real `<select>` for this reason; keep it that way.
- `Intl.DateTimeFormat('bn', {weekday:'short'})` renders `বুধ`, `বৃহস্পতি` — short
  forms that are *not* the dictionary's `বুধবার`/`বৃহস্পতিবার`, so the dashboard
  weekly dots stayed Bengali even though the table looked complete. Match the
  exact form the formatter emits, not the word you expect it to.
- The dashboard builds most of its copy around a live count (`🎯 আজ আর 58টি প্রশ্ন
  বাকি`), so `DICT` can never hold those — they belong in `RULES`. Audit both the
  empty and the populated data states: the two branches render different
  sentences, and a state-blind audit misses half of them.

## FCM notification system (all 5 phases / 8 stages built)

`FCM-NOTIFICATION-BLUEPRINT.md` is the owner-locked 5-phase blueprint for
the FCM + Cloudflare smart notification system (Foundation → Global
topics → Personalized → Events/Automation/Analytics → AI/Scale/Hardening).
Owner decisions: NO Vercel — backend = Cloudflare Worker + D1 `PROFILE_DB`;
Telegram stays backup. **Phase 1 is DEPLOYED to production (Pages 70220493,
admission-gk 1406fb48)** and awaiting the owner's on-device confirmation
(enable FCM push → receive test notification).
Do NOT start Phase 2 work before the owner confirms Phase 1 works on a
real device.

All eight stages are implemented and green in-repo: foundation (permission +
token lifecycle), global fanout, personalization, event notifications,
daily/weekly/monthly digests, open/click analytics, and the Phase 5 pair —
quota-aware resumable fanout + AI-scored send timing (`send-planner.mjs`).
`docs/FCM-PHASES-EXPLAINED.md` maps the owner's 8 stages onto the 5 blueprint
phases. The production-deploy gate still stands: a phase is only "done" once
its output is verified on production and the owner confirms.

SECURITY: the R2 account id must NEVER be hardcoded — read it from the
`R2_ACCOUNT_ID`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` Worker secret via `r2Host(env)`.
A real id was committed in `files-storage.mjs` + `worker-bundle.mjs`; both
are scrubbed and `files-storage.test.mjs` guards the binding. Do not print or
paste any `ADMISSIONHUB_*` secret value.

### Admin Notification Command Center (v2) — standalone page, never injected

The admin composer is `notification-command-center.html`: a self-contained
page with its own sidebar, top bar, mobile tabs and 4 themes. `#notif-admin`
routes to it via `notification-center-route.js`, which does a full-document
hand-off (`window.location.assign`) and keeps the legacy
`window.renderNotificationAdmin` contract.

Do NOT render it inside `#app`. The first v2 attempt did, and it broke
navigation and themes: the page redefines `:root` theme tokens, and its mount
path cleared `navRoot`/`app.innerHTML`. A separate document is what keeps the
two shells from colliding.

Data layer: all admin calls go through `NS.api` with a `Bearer` token stored in
`sessionStorage` (`ahAdminTok`). Auth is a live `GET /api/notifications/history`;
send/schedule/cancel POST to `/api/notifications/global/*`. Typing in the
composer must only call `refreshPreviewOnly()` (patches `.ns-compose-side` in
place) — a full `render()` on `input` closes the mobile keyboard.

The page is a public route in `_worker.js` and `noindex` in `_headers`. The
route shim is shell-precached; run `node scripts/sw-manifest.mjs` after
touching it. Tests: `notification-command-center-backend.test.mjs` (jsdom,
real page, only `fetch` stubbed) + `notification-admin-keyboard.test.mjs`.


 Phases are gated: a phase is done only when its
Output is verified on production, tests are added and green, the full gate
passes, and the
owner confirms — only then may the next phase begin. It extends (never
replaces) the existing Telegram channel + `NotificationHub` in-app system.

## Dual-language UI rule (owner mandate, 2026-09-16 — permanent)

Every piece of NEW UI text (buttons, rows, toasts, sheet/modal copy) must be
written in BOTH Bengali and English, and only the user's active language is
rendered — both languages must NEVER be visible at the same time.

Mechanics (the global i18n engine, index.html):
- Static markup: elements carry `data-bn` + `data-en` (placeholders:
  `data-ph-bn`/`data-ph-en`, aria: `data-aria-bn`/`data-aria-en`); the
  engine's `apply()` picks the active language.
- Dynamically rendered HTML: after inserting it, call
  `window.AhI18n.apply(container)`; or pick the language yourself with
  `window.AhI18n.get()` (returns `'bn'` default / `'en'`) and render one.
- Copy style: official, short, polished (casual/tutorial tone is banned).
Reference implementation: `openSheet()` in `notification-hub.js`
(`SHEET_I18N` table + `sheetT()` helper).

## Deployment access

- `wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name admissionhub --branch main` with
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is the working deploy path.
  In sessions where neither variable is injected (verify with
  `echo ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN:+SET}` before blaming wrangler ÔÇö it reports only
  "necessary to set a CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"), defer the deploy.
- GitHub Actions dispatch is unavailable on this repo: the API returns
  `422 Actions has been disabled for this user`, so the manual
  `workflow_dispatch` publish cannot be triggered with the PAT either. A session
  with no wrangler credentials therefore cannot publish, only commit and push.
- The GitHub PAT in the remote URL can stop working mid-session even though
  pushes succeeded earlier (reflog shows prior `update by push`). A 404 from
  `api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>` while the token itself is valid means
  the repo is gone/renamed or the token's account lost access — it is not a
  push-format problem. Confirm with `GET /user` (token identity) before
  retrying; the deployed site can still ship via wrangler without GitHub.

## FCM / web push

- Two independent faults block push, and fixing the first hides the second:
  1. `/firebase-messaging-sw.js` must exist at the site root (the SDK registers
     that exact path itself). Missing file => `failed-service-worker-registration`.
  2. The SDK registers the SW but **subscribes without waiting for it to
     activate**; on a cold first enable `pushManager.subscribe()` throws
     `no active Service Worker` (error 20). `notification-fcm.js` therefore
     registers the SW itself, waits for `reg.active`, and passes the ready
     registration to `getToken({ serviceWorkerRegistration })` on all three
     paths (enable / disable / refresh). Do not "simplify" that back to a bare
     `getToken()`.
- `vapidKey` is optional: the SDK falls back to its built-in default
  (`BDOU99-h67H...`). An empty `vapidKey` from `/api/notifications/config` is
  not by itself a failure. It cannot be read from any API either — neither the
  FCM v1 REST API nor the Firebase Management API exposes the Web Push
  certificate; it exists only in the Firebase Console, so treat it as
  Console-only and never block a deploy waiting for it.
- The compat SDK exposes **no** `useVapidKey()` / `useVapidKeyIfAvailable()`.
  Verified against the vendored `sdk/firebase-messaging-compat.js` (10.12.2):
  the string does not appear at all, so any branch calling it is dead code and
  the configured key silently never applies. The key must be passed as
  `getToken({ vapidKey })`.
- A real FCM token IS obtainable in this sandbox — the earlier "impossible here"
  note was wrong. Headless Chromium refuses push only because Playwright's
  default context is incognito-like; `launch_persistent_context(dir, ...)` with
  `permissions: ['notifications']` yields a real token. That is the only way to
  exercise the whole client path before shipping. To test the page as it is
  deployed, serve the repo over localhost and `ctx.route()` `/api/notifications/**`
  through to the real worker; the session cookie is then absent, so expect
  `register-401` — reaching 401 is success, it proves the token was created and
  POSTed.
- `firebase-messaging-sw.js` must not call `onBackgroundMessage` when payloads
  carry a `notification` block: the SDK already calls `showNotification()`
  itself, so adding a handler produced two notifications per push.
- Background FCM display happens on the push-scope worker
  (`firebase-messaging-sw.js`), not on `sw.js`: an FCM subscription lives on that
  registration, so the `push` handler in `sw.js` never sees these messages.
  Likewise `navigator.serviceWorker.ready` resolves to the *shell* worker, so
  listening only there silently drops every foreground message — attach the
  `message` listener to every registration instead.
- Cached FCM state lives under `ahFcmEnabled` / `ahFcmLastErr` in localStorage;
  read `ahFcmLastErr` first when diagnosing an owner report. It carries a
  `detail` field with the raw browser/SDK message; without it every distinct
  failure collapses into one unactionable code.
- A KV probe is the cheapest proof of whether a device ever registered: an empty
  `fcm:reg:*` prefix in `GK_KV` means the request never reached the server, so
  the fault is client-side and no amount of worker/secret checking will help.
- Two failure modes are pre-existing on `main` and unrelated to FCM work:
  `p11-dashboard-v2` (2 assertions) and the `dash2f10-main-ai` pins asserted by
  `p13`/`p16`/`p18`/`p21`/`startup-ai-regression` (the repo carries
  `dash2f13-theme`). Confirm any of these against a pristine `git worktree add
  /tmp/base HEAD` before blaming your own change.
- Bumping `BUILD_ID` requires updating every pin at once: `sw.js`, `index.html`
  (3 spots), the `SHELL_VERSION` const in `interactive-native-personal-v1.test.mjs`,
  *and* the `grep -Fq "const BUILD_ID = ..."` assertion in
  `.github/workflows/telegram-auth-canary-activate.yml`. `npm run sw:manifest`
  then rewrites the digests. Miss the workflow file and that test fails only in
  a full-suite run, not when run alone.
- `D1Database.batch()` takes `D1PreparedStatement`s, never raw SQL strings.
  Passing strings throws `D1_ERROR: Malformed input: [{}], should be {sql:
  string, params?: any[]} ...` and aborts the whole sequence. This is how
  `FcmStore.#ensureTables()` silently prevented every push for a day: the
  `CREATE TABLE` batch threw, so `fcm_devices` was never created and every
  register-token write failed. Always wrap DDL in `d1.prepare(...)` before
  batching it.
- Corollary: any D1 test double must *reject* raw strings with that same error.
  A fake that accepts them (`// schema DDL is a no-op here`) turns a
  production-breaking bug into a green suite — the FCM double did exactly that
  for the `batch()` mistake above.
- When a "push never arrives" report reaches you, check the *server* before the
  client. Absent `fcm_devices` / `notification_settings` tables in production D1
  mean registration never succeeded, whatever the client logs say. A non-zero
  `fcm:reg:<user>` counter in `GK_KV` alongside missing tables proves the
  request reached the worker, authenticated, and then died in the store.
- The fastest way to settle a Cloudflare-runtime question (D1 semantics, binding
  behaviour) is a throwaway worker bound to the real resource, deployed, curled,
  then `wrangler delete`d. That produced the definitive `batch()` evidence in
  minutes; reading the docs alone would not have.
- "The server accepted the push" and "the user saw something" are different
  questions — prove them separately. A live HTTP v1 send returning
  `projects/<id>/messages/<uuid>` means FCM took the message; it says nothing
  about display. The v278 report ("enable works, nothing arrives") was entirely
  the second question: `.toast` carried `z-index:100` while the sheet that
  triggers the test renders in `#modalRoot` (`z-index:2000`), so every
  confirmation and every foreground push appeared *behind* the open sheet. When
  feedback is reported missing, check the z-index of the surface that carries it
  against the surface that was open at the time.
- The foreground-push display surface is `.toast` (via `window.toast`). If you
  add another one, keep it above `#modalRoot`/`.modal-bg` too, and extend the
  `notif-sheet.test.mjs` z-index assertion rather than adding a parallel check.
- Payload `src` values are a family, not a single token: the worker sends
  `fcm-welcome`, `fcm-test` and `fcm-self-test`. Service workers must match the
  `fcm` *prefix* — an `=== 'fcm'` test silently sends every tapped notification
  to the default URL. Both `sw.js` and `firebase-messaging-sw.js` handle
  `notificationclick`, so a routing change belongs in both.
- `/internal/notifications/*` is matched by exact path in
  `handleFcmNotificationRequest` (`path === '/internal/notifications/health'`).
  A new `/internal/...` diagnostic returns `null`, falls through to the app
  guard, and answers `403 forbidden` — widen the `isInternal` test while the
  diagnostic exists, and put the exact-path form back when you remove it.
- Two public hosts look like the app but are not: the legacy GitHub Pages
  mirror `sheikhrashel47-stack.github.io/admission-hub-demo` is fully dead
  (every path, including `/index.html` and `/api/...`, returns GitHub's 404),
  and `admission-hub.pages.dev` (hyphenated) serves a stale bundle with no
  auth backend, so `/api/auth/v1/*` answers 405 HTML. The only working origin
  is `admissionhub.pages.dev`. When an auth step dies on a mirror the browser
  receives HTML rather than JSON — `api()` in `account-access.js` labels that
  `ENDPOINT_UNAVAILABLE` so the banner names the wrong host instead of showing
  the generic "সাময়িক সমস্যা" dead end.

## Push delivery: FCM HTTP v1 takes ONE token per send

The global-notification fallback used to POST `{message:{tokens:[...]}}` to
`/v1/projects/<p>/messages:send`. That body belongs to the *batch* endpoint
(`:sendEachForMulticast`, a different URL). Every fallback request got a 400,
so devices that never subscribed to the topic received nothing while the stored
`global_notifications` row still read `sent` and `reachEstimate` counted them.
The failure was invisible because `res.ok` alone was checked.

Rules to keep this correct:
- One request per device: `{message:{token:'<one>', notification, data}}`.
  `fcmSendOne` is the only sender; `fcmSendToTokens` fans out with bounded
  concurrency (`FCM_SEND_CONCURRENCY`) and stops at `FCM_FALLBACK_MAX`.
- `fcm-global.test.mjs`'s stub rejects a `tokens` body with 400, so reverting to
  the array shape fails the suite instead of silently "passing".
- `fcm_devices.topics` is a comma-separated list matched by WHOLE name
  (`activeDevicesMissingTopic` splits it). A bare `LIKE %topic%` would treat
  `course_beginner` as subscribed to `beginner`.
- Client topic subscribe is best-effort and no-ops without a VAPID key, so the
  admin send path also records the sender's own device topic from
  `payload.deviceToken` (`window.AhFcm.getToken()`).

## Deploying without GitHub

The repo lives at `rashelmahmudpc-create/admission-hub-demo` (default branch
`main`). `sheikhrashel47-stack/admission-hub-demo` no longer exists (404), so any
`sheikhrashel47-stack` remote is dead. The in-session `GITHUB_TOKEN` may be
absent; a PAT with `repo`+`workflow` works for the push.

Cloudflare is reachable directly, so ship both halves by hand when CI is not
enough:

```
# worker
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=... npx wrangler@4.35.0 deploy
# pages (rsync is absent in this image — use tar)
tar -cf - --exclude='./.git' --exclude='./node_modules' ... ./ | (cd dist && tar -xf -)
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=... npx wrangler@4.35.0 pages deploy dist \
  --project-name=admissionhub --branch=main
```

Without `--branch=main` the deploy lands as a preview and `admissionhub.pages.dev`
keeps serving the old bundle. Verify with
`curl -s https://admissionhub.pages.dev/ | grep -o 'notification-admin.js?v=[^"]*'`.
An asset can keep the same `?v=` query across a real content change, so a
plain edit ships stale behind the browser/service-worker cache. **Bump the
query string** (`notification-admin.js?v=admin-notif-v7` -> `v8`) and run
`npm run sw:manifest` before every client deploy, then confirm the change is
really live (`curl -s https://admissionhub.pages.dev/notification-admin.js?v=admin-notif-v8 | grep -c keyboard-inset`).

## Deploys shipped (2026-09-24)

| Half | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Worker `admission-gk` | `1caafb52-bcea-4077-8212-72650ae516ef` | FCM Phases 4-5 + `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` secret set |
| Pages `admissionhub` | main (v8 assets) | admin keyboard fix + cache bump |

Set `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` on the worker (`wrangler secret put`) or the R2 usage
probe reports "unknown" (fail-soft; uploads still work).


The working credential pair (verified 2026-09-24) is the injected secret
`ADMISSIONHUB_CLOUDFLARE_API` as the token and `ADMISSIONHUB_CLODFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
(note the spelling) as the account id — pass them as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` /
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` to wrangler. The env-api pair is **not** a Cloudflare
token/account; use the Cloudflare pair above.

The Pages project `admissionhub` is not Git-connected (`source: null`), so a
push to `main` does not rebuild it — every client release is a manual
`pages deploy`. Build the sanitized bundle with `python3` (no `rsync` in the
image): copy the tracked tree minus `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `docs`,
`AGENT_RESUME`, `ai-proxy`, `auth*`, `email-gateway`, `uploads`, `.github`,
`*worker*.js`, `wrangler.toml`, `package*.json`, `*.test.mjs`, `*.md`.

The `workflow_dispatch` deploy pipelines currently cannot run: the repo and both
environments (`github-pages`, `email-gateway-production`) have zero Actions
secrets, so `verify-firebase-config.mjs` aborts with `code=API_KEY_MISSING`. Do
not rely on those workflows until the owner configures secrets.

## Notification delivery invariants (owner bug reports 2026-09-24)

Three production bugs were root-caused from live D1 data and fixed. Keep these
invariants when touching `fcm-notification.mjs` / `notification-admin.js`:

- **One phone = one push.** `fcm_devices.id` is `hash(userId|token)`, so one
  physical device signed into several accounts is several rows. `fcmSendToTokens`
  now de-dupes by `fcm_token` before sending and `activeDeviceCount` counts
  `COUNT(DISTINCT fcm_token)`. Never fan out on raw rows.
- **Icon is the live logo, never a literal.** The FCM payload carries no icon by
  default, so Android showed the OS default "A" avatar. Both send paths set
  `webpush.notification` + `android.notification` icon/badge from the absolute URL
  of `/icons/icon-192.png` (`iconAbsolute(request)`). To change the logo shown in
  notifications, replace that file — no code change, no redeploy.
- **Send and schedule are different dedup intents.** The dedup key used to be
  `type|title|body`, so a test-send of some text made the real scheduled copy of
  the same text impossible to create (409) for 10 days; as a result the
  `global_notifications` table had zero `scheduled_at` rows ever. The key now
  includes the mode (`|now` / `|scheduled|<time>`). A cron sweep also fails rows
  stuck in `status='sending'` (worker killed mid-send) so history never lies.
- **Notification images come from R2.** `POST /api/notifications/global/image`
  (admin Bearer) stores the bytes under `notify/<day>/` and returns a same-origin
  `/api/files/<key>` URL. The admin panel picks a photo from the phone and
  re-encodes it on a canvas first (max 1200px, JPEG 0.85) so a camera shot fits
  the server's 4 MB cap.


## Client button integrity (owner bug report 2026-09-24)

Buttons that "do nothing" are almost always inline handlers calling a function
that no longer exists after a refactor. `dead-handler-guard.test.mjs` scans all
shipped client JS plus `index.html` for `onclick`/`oninput`/etc. attributes that
reference an undefined global, and fails the build on a match. Run it via
`npm run test:ui-guards` (also folded into `test:production-auth`).

- When you remove or rename a global that inline HTML calls, the guard catches
  it. Never silence it by adding a name to `BUILTINS` unless it truly is a
  browser builtin.
- The guard found `openQuestionDetail` (Question Bank "Show Answer") — defined
  nowhere, so every feed card's button was dead. Its real implementation now
  lives in `urgent-fix.js` and renders the answer in the shared `openModal`.
- Inline handlers resolve names at click time from the global scope, so a
  handler defined inside an IIFE is invisible unless it is assigned to `window`.

## Student data: pre-account (legacy) record adoption

`index.html` scopes every IndexedDB record as `DATA_SCOPE::id` with `__ahOwner`,
and `fromScopedRecord` returns `null` for rows owned by a different (or empty)
scope. Rows written before per-account scoping therefore looked wiped on sign-in.

`legacy-adoption.js` (`window.AHLegacyAdoption`) runs once per account, from the
`admissionhub:authchange` handler **before** `seedIfEmpty`, and relabels unscoped
rows in place. Invariants to keep:

- **Relabel, never copy/delete.** The adopted doc is exactly what
  `toScopedRecord` produces, so the physical row count per store is unchanged.
- **Never overwrite account rows.** Same bare id already owned by the account
  means the legacy row is skipped, not merged.
- **Never cross accounts.** Only rows with `__ahOwner === undefined` are
  eligible. Guest rows live in `MEMORY_DB` (session-only) and are cleared on
  sign-out without being adopted.
- **Idempotent + retryable.** A per-account localStorage flag
  (`ahLegacyAdopt:v1:<scope>`) stops re-runs; a store whose write fails is left
  untouched and retried on the next sign-in.
- **Snapshot first, then sync.** A `pre-legacy-adoption` snapshot is taken
  before writes, and each adopted row is announced via `announceLocalWrite` so
  the rescue reaches the cloud instead of staying local-only.
- Raw access lives in `dbScanRaw` / `dbRelabelRaw`, kept separate from the
  scoped `dbGet*` API. Do not loosen `fromScopedRecord` to accept unscoped rows
  -- that would leak one account's data to another.
- Tests: `npm run test:legacy-adoption` (unit + integration against the real
  scoping functions + real IndexedDB via fake-indexeddb).

## AI routes: the gk → public dispatcher env allowlist

`/api/ai/*` is served by `public-worker.js`, but the live Worker is
`gk-agent-worker.js` (name `admission-gk`). Requests are forwarded, and the
`env` the public handler receives is a **hand-built allowlist** (`envPub` in
`gk-agent-worker.js`), not the Worker's full environment.

Consequence: **binding a secret or var is not enough — its name must also be in
`envPub`.** A binding missing there reads as `undefined` downstream no matter
how correctly it was set. This bit twice in one session:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` / `CLOUDFLARE_AI_API_KEY` / `AGENT_CLOUDFLARE_MODELS`
  (Phase 9 M2.5) — the Cloudflare backup stayed invisible
  (`providers.cloudflare: false`) after the secrets were bound and redeployed.
- `USE_CONTEXT_ENGINE` (Phase 9 M4) — enabling the Context Engine had no effect;
  `agentStatus.context` stayed `{ enabled: false }`.

When adding anything the AI path reads from `env`, add it to `envPub` in the
same change, and extend the `account-retirement` guard
(`dispatcher forwards every anonymous-AI provider binding`) so it cannot
regress. Keep the list minimal: it is also the boundary that keeps account
secrets (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, Twilio, mail providers) away from the public AI
handler.

**Deploy propagation:** a `wrangler deploy` can take a minute or two before the
new version serves every edge. A status probe right after deploy may still show
the previous behaviour; re-check before concluding a change did nothing.

**Workers Free variable ceiling is 64** (secrets + text). This Worker sits on it.
Adding a var therefore requires removing one; `AGENT_CLOUDFLARE_MODELS` was
dropped in favour of `USE_CONTEXT_ENGINE` because the router already defaults to
the identical `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast`.

## Student profile → AI context: sanitize twice, consent once (Phase 9 M4.1)

The signed-in student's academic profile reaches the Context Engine at SUMMARY,
but identity fields must never leave the browser. Two gates, both required:

1. **Client** (`ai-agent-chat.js` → `localProfile()`/`profilePayload()`) projects
   the cached profile down to academic fields. A projection is an allowlist: it
   reads named fields only, so a new PII field on the profile cannot leak by
   default.
2. **Server** (`ai-agent.js` → `sanitizeProfileContext()`) re-sanitizes the
   request body, drops every unknown key, and only runs for an `account-` uid.
   A hand-crafted request cannot smuggle a field past the client, and a guest
   uid resolves `profile` to NONE even with a payload attached.

A client-side projection is never sufficient on its own — the server is the only
gate the user cannot edit.

**The first name is automatic — no setting.** The AI greets the signed-in student
by first name with zero setup; there is no toggle anywhere in the UI. Only a
single name token passes, so a full name is rejected even if one is sent. All
other identity fields (mobile, email, DOB, bio, public AH-ID) never leave the
device. Do not reintroduce a name-sharing preference: it made the AI feel harder
to use, and a stale stored `false` from an earlier build would silently keep the
name off for existing accounts.

**New UI copy must be added to `language-engine.js`'s `DICT` in the same change** —
`language-engine.test.mjs` scans `profile-ui.js` and fails on any Bengali literal
without an English key.

## System prompt lives in the registry, not inline (Phase 9 M5)

`buildSystemPrompt()` in `ai-agent.js` starts from `getPromptText(BASE_PROMPT_ID)`;
the actual wording lives in `prompt-registry.js` as a frozen `v1` entry with
`promptId / version / purpose / createdAt / status`, plus a `legacyVersion` alias
to `SYSTEM_PROMPT_V`.

- **Never edit the prompt text in `ai-agent.js`** — it is no longer there. Change
  `prompt-registry.js`, and add a new version entry rather than overwriting `v1`.
- The composed base prompt is pinned by SHA-256 in
  `phase9-m5-prompt-registry.test.mjs` (2044 bytes). Any wording change must
  update that hash deliberately — an accidental drift fails the suite.
- Conditional blocks (onboarding, exam mode, quiz, prefs, stats) still append on
  top of the shared base in `buildSystemPrompt()`; keep them there, not in the
  registry.
- `prompt-registry.js` is pure data plus helpers: no `env`, no I/O, no worker API.

## Tools are declared, never executed yet (Phase 9 M6)

`tool-registry.js` declares tools and enforces cross-user isolation at the tool
boundary (finding S6). It is pure data plus pure guards — no `env`, no I/O.

- **Nothing executes.** The chat path in `ai-agent.js` must not call
  `authorizeToolCall()` until a later, owner-approved step wires execution. A test
  (M6-১৩) fails if `executeTool`/`runTool`/`invokeTool`/`authorizeToolCall`
  appears in `ai-agent.js`.
- **Owner comes from the uid alone.** `resolveToolOwner()` accepts only an
  `account-` uid. Never trust an owner supplied by the model or the request body;
  `authorizeToolCall()` rejects eight owner-ish argument keys and returns the
  caller as the owner, and `guardToolResult()` blocks any result whose `ownerUid`
  does not match the caller.
- **READ-only is the ceiling for the tool registry.** `validateToolRegistry()`
  fails if any non-READ tool is enabled; write/execute live in the separate M9
  action layer (`action-engine.js`). Every tool must be `ownerScoped: true`.
- Adding a tool means adding a full declaration (name/description/permission/
  inputSchema/outputSchema/riskLevel/enabled); the validator rejects partial ones.

## Memory is a typed engine, automatic for accounts, closed to guests (Phase 9 M7)

`memory-engine.js` adds the long-term memory layer the audit called missing. The
short-term layer (`chatmem:<uid>`, rolling window, `summarizeTo`) is unchanged.
It is pure data plus pure guards — no `env`, no I/O, no model call.

- **Owner override.** The plan's M7 gate was "default OFF, explicit consent"; the
  owner overrode it. Long-term memory is automatic for a signed-in student with
  **no toggle, no prompt and no expiry**. `sanitizeAiPrefs()` no longer accepts a
  `memory` field, and the AI Personalization sheet has no MEMORY switch. Do not
  reintroduce a toggle without an owner decision.
- **Guests have no memory.** `resolveMemoryOwner()` returns a uid only for an
  `account-` prefix. Guest AI is refused outright: `agentChat` returns
  `401 sign_in_required` before parsing, and the chat client + quiz generator stop
  before the request. `identity.uid` alone is the owner — never the body.
- **No PII.** `isPiiFree()` rejects email, BD mobile, long digit runs, dates and
  password/OTP/PIN/CVV wording. A record is checked at both write and read.
- **Isolation is a second gate.** `parseMemory()`/`upsertMemory()`/
  `guardMemoryRecord()` drop any record whose `ownerUid` is not the caller.
- **Only three kinds** are storable: `studies`, `preference`, `habit`. Confidence
  must be ≥ `CONFIDENCE_MIN` (0.7); `MAX_RECORDS` (500) bounds storage and
  `RENDER_LIMIT` (24) bounds the prompt.
- **Both extraction triggers** live in `extractMemoryCandidates()`: an explicit
  "মনে রাখো" and a study/preference/habit fact stated in passing. A candidate
  still has to clear `makeMemory()`.
- `agentStatus` advertises `memory: { version: 'mem-v1', mode: 'auto',
  scope: 'account-only' }` — metadata only; the prompt base and its SHA-256 are
  untouched.

## Responses are validated before render, high-precision only (Phase 9 M8)

`response-validator.js` checks every model response on four dimensions — schema,
safety, data, action — and returns a structured envelope
`{version, type, message, insights, recommendations, actions, confidence}`. It is
pure data plus pure guards — no `env`, no I/O, no model call. `ai-agent.js` runs it
inside `finalize()` (persist decision) and around the provider loop (returned
text); the client learned one new SSE frame.

- **Rewriting is deliberately rare.** Only six classes replace the text: schema,
  internal-leak, credential-request, secret-material, action-claim, false-success.
  `invented-stats` and `quiz-contract` are recorded, never rewritten. A guard that
  rewrites a legitimate academic answer is worse than the risk it covers — so if
  you add a pattern, it must be self-disclosure shaped, not keyword shaped, and
  must ship with a passing counterpart test.
  - "My system prompt is …" blocks; *"System prompt কী?"* passes.
  - "তোমার OTP দাও" blocks; "লগইন করতে password দাও" passes (`APP_TARGET_RE`
    recognizes instructions aimed at the app's own field).
  - "ভেরিফিকেশন হয়ে গেছে" blocks; "ভেরিফিকেশন সফল হলে ইমেইল পাবে" passes.
  - `invented-stats` needs a *provided* value to contradict; with no stats the
    claim is a guess, not proof.
- **No new Worker variable.** `wrangler.toml` is at the 64-var cap, so enforcement
  is the `ENFORCE` constant in the module (currently `true`), not a binding.
- **A blocked reply is never persisted.** `finalize()` returns early unless
  `validateResponse(...).persistable`; an unsafe reply cannot become a conversation
  turn or a memory record. Guards run after the guest `401` gate, so guests are
  still refused before anything is parsed.
- **Streaming uses `event: replace`.** Text is already on the wire when the full
  reply is known, so the server sends the safe text in a `replace` frame before
  `done`; the client swaps it in via `textContent` (never `innerHTML`). A clean
  stream emits no `replace` frame.
- **Shape stays backward compatible.** `text`/`intent`/`pv`/`agent`/`authoritative`
  are unchanged; `structured` is additive. Envelope `actions` comes from the M9
  action layer.
- `agentStatus` advertises `response: { version: 'rv-v1', enforced: true,
  classes, blocking }`.

## Write/execute actions are live, gated by a config kill-switch (Phase 9 M9)

`action-engine.js` is the write/execute permission layer the audit called missing:
READ/WRITE/EXECUTE are separate classes, every action needs an explicit
confirmation, and every attempt is audited. Like M6/M7 it is pure data plus pure
guards — no `env`, no I/O, no model call. The Worker's `/api/ai/actions/*` routes
do the KV writes; the engine only decides whether they may happen.

- **The layer is live.** `ENABLED` is `true` (owner decision, 2026-09-24), so the
  routes work for signed-in students and the chat advertises
  `actions.enabled: true`. `validateActionEngine()` still fails if a declaration
  is inconsistent.
- **Turning it off needs no code change.** `actionsEnabled(env)` is the
  kill-switch: it returns `false` only for `USE_WRITE_ACTIONS = "disabled"`, and
  `true` for any other value including unset. The variable **must not** be added
  to `wrangler.toml`: the Worker already sits on the Workers Free ceiling of 64
  variables and a 65th is rejected on deploy (`code: 10055`). Bind it as a
  dashboard secret instead.
- **`ready` ≠ enabled.** `prefs.write` is declared `ready: true` (the declaration
  is complete); `listActions()` reports `enabled: ENABLED && ready`.
- **Confirmation is mandatory, short-lived, single-use.** A proposal carries
  `expiresAt = now + 5 min`. `confirmProposal()` checks the layer, the caller's
  ownership, the token and the expiry. The Worker deletes the stored proposal
  *before* the write, so a replayed token finds nothing (`no-proposal`).
- **Owner is the server-validated uid, never the body.** `resolveActionOwner()`
  only accepts an `account-` prefix. `sanitizeActionArgs()` *rejects* (does not
  strip) a payload naming an owner, and keeps only declared argument keys.
- **Every attempt is audited** under `actaudit:<uid>`: `proposed`, then
  `confirmed` / `denied` / `expired` / `failed`. `parseAudit()` keeps only the
  caller's own records and treats corrupt history as empty; history is bounded at
  `MAX_AUDIT` (200).
- **Guests leave no trace** — all three routes return `401 sign_in_required`
  before reading a body or touching KV.
- `agentStatus` advertises `actions: { version: 'act-v1', enabled, confirmTtlMs,
  declared }` — shape only, never a capability.
- **Low-risk preferences confirm themselves; the card is for everything else.**
  An explicit personalization request in the student's own words (`actParseIntent`)
  is sent to `/api/ai/actions/propose`; the reply becomes a card. `prefs.write` is
  listed in `AUTO_CONFIRM_ACTIONS`, so it is confirmed in the same pass and the
  card only ever paints the terminal outcome — saying "উত্তর ছোট করে দাও" simply
  applies the change, with no tap. Every other action (anything not on that
  one-entry allowlist) renders the *server-built* `summary` with yes/no buttons
  and waits: nothing is written until the student taps "yes", which confirms with
  the single-use token; "no" resolves locally and calls nothing. If an
  auto-confirm never reaches the Worker the card stays pending and tappable and
  warns offline — never a false success. `offerAction()` falls back to a normal
  answer when the layer is off or the action is denied, so the chat still works
  without writes. A proposal older than its TTL is retired locally rather than
  round-tripped. The UI never touches `aiprefs:` itself — the Worker is the only
  writer, and the propose/confirm handshake is unchanged.

## Admin auth (Notification Command Center)

- Admin routes (`ADMIN_PATHS` in `fcm-notification.mjs`) accept either the
  `ADMIN_TOKEN` bearer (break-glass) or an `X-Admin-Session` header minted by
  `/api/admin/webauthn/assert`. Both paths are covered by `admin-passkey.test.mjs`.
- Passkey implementation lives in `admin-passkey.mjs` and reuses
  `auth-native/core/webauthn.mjs` (the student-passkey verifier) - do not add a
  second WebAuthn implementation.
- No new Worker variables: `ADMIN_TOKEN` doubles as the HMAC key for challenge
  MACs, because Workers Free caps a Worker at 64 variables. Rotating
  `ADMIN_TOKEN` invalidates all challenges and sessions; enrolled credentials
  survive (they are public keys).
- Sessions are stored hashed in `GK_KV` (`admin:pk:sess:<sha256>`), 30 min TTL.
  Enrolled credentials: `admin:pk:cred:<credentialId>`. Challenges:
  `admin:pk:chal:<challengeId>`, 120 s, single-use.
- Enrollment requires the admin token by design; only assertion is token-free.
- Run `npm run test:fcm` before touching auth code - it includes the passkey
  suite. `npm run test:ui-guards` covers the NCC handler wiring.

## Every AI request leaves a trace, and a cost is never invented (Phase 9 M10)

`observability.js` closes the last two audit gaps (§52 items 9/10): per-request
telemetry and a countable spend. It is wired into `ai-agent.js` where a request
actually finishes — the one-shot reply, the streaming `done` event, and both
provider-failure paths. Like M6/M7/M9 it is pure data plus pure guards.

- **A trace is not a transcript.** `makeTrace()` records `rid`, an 8-hex
  `callerRef`, provider, model, intent, tier, latency, token estimate, cost,
  fallback reason and the prompt/context/agent versions — and nothing else.
  `FORBIDDEN_TRACE_KEYS` (uid, text, content, messages, prompt, key, token, args,
  summary, email, phone) is checked on build *and* on `renderTrace()`, so a call
  site that passes a whole message object by mistake still cannot leak content
  into the log. `renderTrace()` strips newlines so a trace cannot forge extra log
  lines.
- **A cost is never invented.** `PRICING` ships **empty on purpose**: the Gemini
  aliases in `GEMINI_MODELS` are preview/lite and their rates move, so a guessed
  rate would silently corrupt every total derived from it. An unpriced model
  returns `costUsd: null, priced: false`; `addUsage()` counts those requests in a
  separate `unpriced` bucket so a figure is never read as complete when part of it
  is unknown. Fill `PRICING.<provider>.<model> = { in, out }` when the owner has
  the current sheet — nothing else changes. A half-filled rate counts as absent.
- **Token counts are estimates.** `estimateTokens()` is a ~4-chars-per-token
  approximation (no tokeniser exists inside a Worker) and
  `describeObservability().tokenCount` says so.
- **It adds zero KV writes.** The chat path already spends its two-write budget on
  the rate counter and memory, so traces go to the Worker's log sink instead. A
  test asserts no `obs`-prefixed KV write appears in the orchestrator.
- **`quotaState()`** turns the existing `airl:` counter into
  used/remaining/exhausted plus an 80% warning. The `429 rate_limited` reply keeps
  its code and `cap` and gains a `remaining` field; the `airl:` key format is
  unchanged.
- **History is bounded and corrupt-safe:** `appendTrace()` keeps the newest
  `MAX_TRACES` (200); `parseTraces()` treats bad JSON as empty and filters to the
  caller's own `callerRef`.
- `agentStatus` advertises `observability: describeObservability()` — shape only,
  never a capability.

**Phase 9 (M1–M10) is complete.**

## AI chat cap: 10 messages per student per rolling 24h (M11)

The owner-set ceiling. A signed-in student gets **10 messages**, then 10 more 24
hours after the *first message of the window* — not at UTC midnight.

- `AGENT_DAILY_CAP` overrides the cap, but the **code default is 10** (was 80).
  There is no variable in `wrangler.toml` on purpose: the Worker sits on the
  Workers Free 64-variable ceiling. The floor is 1 (was 10), so a smaller cap set
  from the dashboard is honoured rather than silently raised.
- The counter key is `airl:<uid>` (no date suffix) and the value is
  `{"n":<count>,"start":<epoch-ms>}`. `readQuota(raw, now)` keeps `n` while
  `now - start < 24h` and otherwise resets to `0`/`now`. Legacy integer values and
  corrupt JSON are both handled (corrupt ⇒ empty, never throws).
- Why not the old calendar key: `airl:<uid>:<yyyy-mm-dd>` reset at UTC midnight =
  6am Dhaka, so "daily" did not mean 24 hours from the student's first message.
- Still **one KV write per chat** (`expirationTtl` 172800). The `429` keeps
  `rate_limited` + `cap`, adds `remaining`, and says "২৪ ঘণ্টা পর আবার চেষ্টা করো".

Run `node ai-agent-f1.test.mjs` after touching the limiter — its async cases
share one mocked `globalThis.fetch`, so the harness runs them **sequentially**
(they used to run concurrently and clobber each other's mocks).



## Test suite health and the notification panel's i18n table

The full suite must stay green: `node --test` (currently **1089/1089**). Four
failures that used to sit on `main` were **test-toolchain gaps, not app bugs**:

- **`better-sqlite3` on Node 24.** `profile-core` and `session-recovery-chaos`
  asserted fine, then the process aborted *at exit* inside better-sqlite3
  11.10.0's `Statement` destructor (`RemoveEnvironmentCleanupHook`). Node 24
  needs **`better-sqlite3 ^12.11.1`**. If a sqlite-tied suite "fails" with every
  assertion passing and a native teardown trace, suspect this first.
- **`fake-indexeddb`** was imported by `legacy-adoption.e2e` but never declared,
  so that suite could not run anywhere. It is a devDependency now.
- **Wall-clock-dependent tests.** The `personalized-notification` decision tests
  pass a fixed `NOW`, but the admin HTTP routes read the real clock, so
  `preview` only failed *outside* the 08:00-22:00 Asia/Dhaka send window.
  `handlePersonalizedNotificationRequest(request, env, deps)` now takes an
  injectable `{ now }`; the worker passes its `ExecutionContext` (no `.now`), so
  runtime is unchanged. **Any new route that reads `Date.now()` needs the same
  seam** - otherwise its test is flaky by hour.

### i18n: label strings with the language they are written in

`notification-command-center.html` is the only file with a translation table
(`const T = {...}`). `t()` returns `e.en` for English and `e.bn` for Bangla, so a
mislabeled entry **fails silently**:

- A Bangla string stored under `en:` shows Bengali in English mode, or - if the
  key is duplicated as `en:` twice - renders **blank** in Bangla.
- A fully swapped pair shows the wrong language in *both* modes.

`i18n-guard.test.mjs` locks this down (no Bengali under `en:`, no duplicate
language keys, no identical Bengali value under both). Run it after editing `T`.
Sample-student fields follow the same rule: `initial` is now `{bn,en}` and is
picked through `LANG`, not hardcoded Bengali.

Verify panel changes in a real DOM, not just by reading the diff - a `jsdom`
harness that stubs `fetch`, calls `NotificationStudio.setLang`/`setState`, and
greps `#nsView` for the Bengali Unicode range catches leaks that source review
misses.
## Analytics Foundation (Phase 1 GA4) — `analytics-service.js`

The app talks to Firebase Analytics **only** through `window.AhAnalytics`; no
other module loads the Firebase SDK or calls `logEvent`. Full reference:
`docs/ANALYTICS-FOUNDATION.md`.

- **Dictionary-first.** Events and parameters are declared in the `EVENTS` map.
  An event that is not declared is rejected, and a parameter that is not listed
  for that event is dropped — that is what keeps the data queryable. Add to the
  dictionary before tracking something new.
- **Privacy is a hard filter.** `FORBIDDEN_PARAM` strips password/secret/token/
  api-key/credential/cookie/email/phone/address/full-name/answer/message/free
  text/etc. regardless of what the dictionary says. `setUserContext` stores only
  an opaque id and the first name (read from `ah-profile-cache-key`, exactly like
  `ai-agent-chat.js`) — never email, phone or full name.
- **Never throws.** Every public call is wrapped; analytics failure is never app
  failure. `status()` reports `reasons` for every dropped event.
- **Environment separation.** Transmission requires the production origin
  (`admissionhub.pages.dev`). Other origins are `disabled`; `?ahanalytics=debug`
  traces to the console and sends nothing.
- **Wiring.** `index.html` loads `analytics-service.js` right after
  `session-persist.js`, then calls `attach()` + `start()`. Screen views ride
  `admission:route-rendered`; session/user context rides
  `admissionhub:authchange`; learning completions ride `admission:activity`
  (`TEST_COMPLETED`, `REVISION_COMPLETED`).
- **Live, via a code default.** `fcm-notification.mjs` ships
  `DEFAULT_MEASUREMENT_ID = 'G-06DEZGLFJE'` (the `admission-hub-web` stream), so
  `/api/notifications/config` returns a `measurementId` and GA4 transmits. The
  planned `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` binding is **not** used: the Worker sits on
  the Workers Free 64-variable ceiling, and a 65th is rejected on deploy
  (`code: 10055`). Bind `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` as a dashboard secret only
  after freeing a slot — an env value overrides the default. A measurement ID is
  public, so the default leaks nothing.
- **SDK.** `sdk/firebase-analytics-compat.js` is self-hosted (download from
  gstatic 10.12.2), matching the messaging SDK pattern; gstatic is the fallback.
- **Bump discipline.** `analytics-service.js` is in `APP_SHELL`, so after editing
  it run `npm run sw:manifest`. The shell build id lives in `sw.js` (`BUILD_ID`),
  `index.html` (`expectedSwVersion`, `sw.js?v=`, cache-purge literal) and the
  version-pinned test suites — `scripts/cache-bump.mjs` lists them; a manual bump
  always misses one.
- Run `node analytics-service.test.mjs` after touching the service; it is part of
  `npm run test:native-auth`.

## Phase 2 — Learning Instrumentation (M1)

Phase 2 (`docs/PHASE-02-LEARNING-ANALYTICS.md`) turns the Phase 1 foundation into
learning behaviour data. Its first milestone ships in this build.

- **Emit on the bus, not in the service.** No module imports `AhAnalytics`.
  Learning surfaces dispatch `admission:activity` with a semantic `type`;
  `analytics-service.js` owns the `LEARNING_BUS_TYPES` mapping (e.g.
  `LESSON_COMPLETE` → `lesson_complete`) and relies on `normalizeEvent`'s
  camelCase → snake_case pass. Add the bus type there, not a new caller.
- **Quiz completions are explicit.** `TEST_COMPLETED`/`REVISION_COMPLETED` map
  to `quiz_complete` by hand, because `resultId`/`sessionId` must become
  `quiz_id` — the generic path would emit `result_id` and drop a required param.
- **Full quiz summary.** The exam engine now sends `questionCount`, `correct`,
  `wrong`, `skipped`, `accuracy`, `duration`, `mode`, `testType` on
  `TEST_COMPLETED`; the Phase 1 handler always read them, but nothing sent them.
- **Live course surface is `source-course-tool.js`.** `interactive-course-tool.js`
  is dead code — its `interactive-courses` route is in `index.html`'s
  `removedRoute` list. Do not instrument it.
- **Privacy unchanged.** No message text, no search query, only opaque ids.

## Phase 2 — Course/Lesson + Quiz/Practice analytics (M2, M3)

Milestones M2 and M3 ship in this build (`docs/PHASE-02-LEARNING-ANALYTICS.md`
§3). `EVENT_VERSION` is now `ev2`.

- **Course pages really do have lessons.** `courses/*/index.html` ships
  `section.lesson-sec#lessonN` and the source's own `button.done-btn[data-lesson]`
  ("পড়া শেষ ✓"). `source-course-tool.js` mirrors that UI (observer for
  `lesson_view`/`lesson_start`, delegated click for `lesson_complete`) — never
  re-implement completion.
- **Never gate a tall element on an intersection ratio.** A lesson section is
  taller than the phone viewport (measured 3270px vs ~844px), so
  `threshold: 0.25` is unreachable and the event never fires — while
  `lesson_complete` still works, so the gap is invisible in tests. Keep
  `threshold: 0`. jsdom has no `IntersectionObserver`, so the suite silently
  takes the no-observer fallback; stub it when a test must cover the real path
  (see `m2-7`/`m2-8`). Verify behavioural claims like this against the live site
  in a headless browser, not only against the suite.
- **Filter scripts by type before `new Function()`.** Course HTML also carries a
  `<script type="application/ld+json">` SEO block. Concatenating it into the
  executable bundle throws `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'` and **no course
  opens**. Only `''`/`text/javascript`/`application/javascript`/`module` may be
  concatenated. This regressed live once (commit `24f6ade`); `m2-3`…`m2-5` in
  `source-course-lessons.test.mjs` guard it.
- **Per-question depth.** `selectMockAnswer`/`selectFlashAnswer` in `index.html`
  dispatch `QUESTION_ATTEMPT` (exam id as `quiz_id`) with `correct`, `duration`,
  `question_number`, `subject_id`, `topic_id`, `mode`. Emitted only on a
  committed answer, and repeatable.
- **Dedupe keys join every required param.** The old key used the first identity
  field (`course_id`), so `lesson_complete` fired once per course. Build the key
  from `EVENTS[name].required`. Pinned by `analytics-service.test.mjs` a28/a29.
- **Adding an event means three edits.** Dictionary entry, `LEARNING_BUS_TYPES`
  entry, and the a1 coverage list in `analytics-service.test.mjs`; bump
  `EVENT_VERSION` too.
- **Run the course test after touching the tool.** `node
  source-course-lessons.test.mjs` boots the real tool against the real sandhi
  HTML in jsdom; it is wired into `npm run test:native-auth`.

## Phase 2 — Funnel, Drop-off, Engagement, Data Quality (M4–M7)

Milestones M4–M7 are one pure engine, `buildLearningInsights()`, in
`analytics-service.js` (`docs/PHASE-02-LEARNING-ANALYTICS.md` §5). No DOM, no
storage, no network — so the same function runs in the browser, in `node:test`,
and (later) in an admin surface.

- **Funnel steps are EVENTS, never screens.** `FUNNEL_STEPS` = `course_view →
  course_start → lesson_start → lesson_complete → quiz_start → quiz_complete`.
  `trackScreen` collapses `source-courses/sandhi` to `source-courses` (pinned by
  a16), so a screen-based funnel merges every course into one bar. Pinned by
  `m4-2`.
- **Drop-off must not cry wolf.** Alert only when a step drops ≥ `0.4` AND at
  least `DROPOFF_MIN_SAMPLE = 5` reached it; ties break toward the earliest step.
  Three students losing two is noise, not a signal (`m5-2`).
- **The engine is feedable from the GA4 Data API later.** It accepts either
  `{ events }` or pre-counted `{ counts }`, so an admin panel can pass a Data API
  response straight in without a second implementation.
- **The on-device ledger is the only new storage.** `trackEvent` appends each
  already-filtered row to `ahLearningLedgerV1` (500 rows, `readLedger()`), so the
  admin/quality check has something to read before the Data API is enabled. It
  stores exactly what was sent — never add a field that `normalizeEvent` would
  strip.
- **The course MCQ engine is a quiz surface too.** `SourceCourse.answer`
  dispatches `QUESTION_ATTEMPT` and the result screen dispatches `QUIZ_COMPLETE`
  (bus mapping `QUIZ_COMPLETE → quiz_complete`). Emit `quizId`, not `resultId`:
  the generic bus path has no `resultId → quiz_id` mapping (only the legacy
  `TEST_COMPLETED`/`EXAM_COMPLETED` rows do), so `resultId` would silently drop
  the required `quiz_id` and the event with it.
- **`scripts/cache-bump.mjs` bumps `analytics-service.js`** (added in v288). It
  used to be missed, leaving `APP_VERSION_FALLBACK` stale behind the shell
  version. If you add a file that carries a `v###` build string, add it there.
- **Data-quality checks reuse the dictionary.** `checkDataQuality()` reads
  `EVENTS[name].required`/`.once`, so it can never drift from what
  `normalizeEvent` enforces. Do not hardcode a second list.
- **The ledger is cached in memory and flushed on a timer.** `recordLedger`
  pushes into an in-memory array and schedules a single `flushLedger` (400 ms),
  so a 60-question quiz is not 60 full re-parses of a 500-row array. `flushLedger`
  is on the public API for tests and for any caller that must read it
  immediately; `readLedger()` returns the same cached array.
- **`sw.js` APP_SHELL and `index.html` must name the same query string.** The
  deploy guard (`npm run check:sw-manifest`) regenerates `ASSET_DIGESTS` and fails
  if `sw.js` changes — but it hashes the query that `APP_SHELL` lists. Bumping a
  query in `index.html` without editing `APP_SHELL` produces a digest for the new
  file under the old key, so the guard can never be satisfied. Change both, then
  run `npm run sw:manifest`.
- **Live verification needs the auth gate lifted.** Signed-out sessions keep
  `#app` at `display:none` behind `ah-account-page-active`, which collapses every
  lesson section to zero height and starves the lesson `IntersectionObserver`.
  A headless check of `lesson_view`/`lesson_start` must remove that class and
  un-hide `#app` first; otherwise it reports a false "missing events" failure.
- **A background push reaches the SW wrapped in `data.FCM_MSG`.** When a payload
  carries a `notification` block (every sender here sets one), the Firebase SDK
  shows the notification itself and sets `notification.data = { FCM_MSG: <payload> }`
  — see `t.data={[ut]:e}` with `ut="FCM_MSG"` in `sdk/firebase-messaging-compat.js`.
  Our `link`/`gid`/`src` therefore live at `data.FCM_MSG.data.*`, not at the top
  level. Reading them directly made every tap fall through to `./` and silently
  dropped global click logging. Unwrap first, then keep the flat shape as a
  fallback. `sw.js` is the exception: it builds its own flat `data` before
  `showNotification`, so it needs no unwrap.
- **Substring assertions cannot test a service worker branch.** The SW contract
  test only grepped the source for expected strings, so a wrong condition passed
  for months. Run the handler instead: `notification-sw-routing.test.mjs` executes
  the real `notificationclick` in a `vm` sandbox and asserts the URL opened.
- **The Pages UI deploys only from the manual workflow.** Pushing to `main` runs
  the bundle *guard* (`cf-pages.yml`, build-only) and GitHub's own
  `pages build and deployment`, but neither publishes to Cloudflare. Run
  `Deploy Pages UI + Worker (manual)` with `confirmation=DEPLOY`; the API
  dispatch needs the `inputs` field or it returns 422.

## Phase 3 — notification intelligence (v289)

- **The handler order is load-bearing.** `handleFcmNotificationRequest` answers
  `404` for any `/api/notifications/*` path it does not recognise, so
  `handleIntelligenceRequest` must be registered *before* it or `/intel/*`,
  `/intel-pref` and `/outcome` are swallowed. Add any future
  `/api/notifications/*` handler with the same care.
- **Never answer OPTIONS before claiming the path.** A handler that runs ahead of
  the other `/api/*` handlers and returns `204` for every preflight will answer
  CORS for the entire app. `handleIntelligenceRequest` checks its own paths
  (`OWNED_PATHS` + `ADMIN_PREFIX`) *first* and returns `null` otherwise.
- **The daily cap is shared with Phase G.** Both engines claim the same
  `notification_sends(user_id, kind, day_key)` row, so enabling the intelligence
  layer cannot double a student's daily allowance. `kind` is namespaced
  (`intel:<kind>`) so the two engines do not collide on the same row.
- **A blocked candidate must not stop the list.** The pipeline walks the ranked
  candidates and takes the first that clears duplicate/frequency/cooldown, so a
  capped *learning* nudge still lets a *streak* nudge through. When everything is
  blocked, the reported `stage` is the first block hit, not a generic
  `all-suppressed`.
- **A/B variants must be deterministic and copy-only.** `assignVariant` hashes
  `userId|kind`, so a cron tick cannot reshuffle an experiment mid-flight; and
  variants never change eligibility, only the message text.
- **Conversion credit refuses pre-tap learning.** `attributeConversion` floors the
  window at the open/click time, because a lesson started *before* the tap cannot
  have been caused by it. Only `LEARNING_KINDS` count.
- **Timezone is per student and clamped.** The client reports its real UTC offset
  (`AhFcm.syncTimezone`, once per session); the server clamps to −720…+840 minutes
  and defaults to Dhaka. Quiet hours and the send window follow that offset, not
  the server clock.
- **Fatigue silences nudges, never good news.** `celebration: true` kinds still
  reach a fatigued student; the daily cap drops for the rest.
- **Behaviour reads are read-only.** The engine reads `user_daily_stats`,
  `user_exam_results`, `user_mistakes`, `user_activity`, `user_settings` and never
  writes them — the signals layer owns no other feature's data.
- **Watch for tests that pass vacuously.** The Phase G "running twice in one day"
  test used a *fresh* store on the second run, so the run stopped at
  `fcm-not-configured` before reaching the duplicate guard. Duplicate/daily-cap
  tests must reuse one store across both runs, or they prove nothing.
- **`firebase-messaging-sw.js` click records now have two branches.** A global
  push carries `gid`, an intelligence push carries `key`; the SW stores whichever
  it sees and the page routes each to its own endpoint.
- **`scripts/cache-bump.mjs` also bumps `sw.js`'s `BUILD_ID`.** If you add a file
  that carries the `v###-…` build string, add it to the script's target list.
- **A fixture that invents the fields the API never returns hides contract
  drift.** `notification-command-center-backend.test.mjs` stubbed
  `/api/notifications/history` with a body that happened to include `opened`,
  `imageUrl` and `targetUrl`, so it passed while the real Worker sent none of
  them: `recentGlobals()` omitted `image_url`/`target_url` from its `SELECT`
  (the expanded row showed "none") and per-item opens live in
  `analytics.items`, not on the row (Opens always read 0). A stub is only
  trustworthy if it is produced by the code under test. `notification-panel-history-seam.test.mjs`
  runs the real `FcmStore` over an in-memory D1 and feeds its exact output into
  the real page in jsdom; its D1 fake honours `SELECT` column projection, so a
  dropped column disappears the same way it does in production. Reverting any of
  the four fixes makes it fail.
- **A rate limiter's counter is not the size of the history table.** The quota
  widget rendered `state.sent.length` as "used", so any month with more than 10
  notifications displayed e.g. "50 / 10". `/api/notifications/history` now
  reports `dailyUsed`, read from the limiter's own KV counter (`kvRatePeek`,
  non-consuming). The cap resets at 00:00 **UTC** — one UTC-dated KV entry with a
  24h TTL — so the key is `utcDayKey` and the label says UTC; the old name
  `dhakaDayKey` and an "Asia/Dhaka" label were both wrong for 6 hours a day.
- **Check `test:fcm` membership when adding a notification test.** A test file
  that is never listed in the script never runs in CI.
  `notification-sw-routing.test.mjs` sat unwired until this change.
