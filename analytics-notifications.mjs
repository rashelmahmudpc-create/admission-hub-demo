/* Phase 4 (FCM blueprint) — notification analytics.
 *
 * The blueprint asks to see which notifications are effective: Sent, Delivered,
 * Opened, Clicked, Failed, Invalid token, CTR, Engagement. Every one of those
 * already exists somewhere in the Phase 1–2 schema; nothing new is collected
 * here. This module reads them together and does the arithmetic in one pure
 * place so the admin figure and the tests cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Definitions used (so the numbers mean one thing everywhere):
 *   Sent       — a notification row whose send was attempted and accepted.
 *   Delivered  — distinct devices that accepted the message (topic reach, or
 *                the per-device fallback count when the topic was not usable).
 *   Failed     — a row that could not be delivered to any device.
 *   Opened     — rows in notification_reads: the student opened the item in the
 *                Notification Center. Opened is a subset of delivered.
 *   Clicked    — taps recorded on the row's action link.
 *   CTR        — clicked / delivered, as a percentage.
 *   Engagement — opened / delivered, as a percentage.
 *
 * All math is pure and takes plain rows; the D1 reads are thin SQL.
